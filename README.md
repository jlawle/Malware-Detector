# Malware-Detector
This program inputs malware, in the representation of an image, to accurately learn and classify new sets of malware between benign and malignant files.

## Process
First, the data is converted and examined by the program. The way in which malware is converted to images is simple: via grayscale representation. Given 8 bits at a time from a benign or malignant executable, we convert each 8 bits to its grayscale value and output to an image.

## Model Detection and results

For malware detection software, it is ideal to minimize the quantity of false negatives (FN). In the case of a false negative, malware has effectively evaded detection and may continue infecting a system. We run the model through two different characterstic window sizes. These window sizes are used to peruse through a given image and compile it's detection technique from. The best results were achieved with a window size of 256x256 pixels. 

Shown below is the training validation and accuracy and loss graphs for our best performing model:

With these results, we can also show the result in correct vs incorrect detections across a large dataset of benign and malignant malware:

Also calculated is the rate of false positives to false negatives:

Overall, these results are substantially better than original methods found for malware detection.
